<h2>TauBench</h2>

This is the alpha release of a unstructured grid benchmark. TauBench
is a pseudo benchmark. The respective kernels are derived from Tau
(a Navier Stokes solver which has been developed at the German
aerospace research DLR in Germany). The original flow solver is a
three-dimensional parallel hybrid multigrid solver, which uses a
finite volume scheme in order to solve the Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes equations.  The benchmark itself doesn't do anything
useful in terms of producing meaningful results - rather it is meant
to mimic the run-time performance of the Tau solver.

<h2>Install</h2>

    make


To change a compiler

    make MPICC=mpicc

<h2>Run</h2>
Tau supports both vector and cache colored grids, you might also need
to adapt the compiler directives in [nodep.h](./nodep.h) and [expand.h](./expand.h).m

The benchmark itself can be used with two flags, the gridsize per
process and the number of pseudo steps:

~~~
$ mpirun -np 2 ./taubench -n 100000 -s 10
This is TauBench.
Evaluating kernels - please be patient.
